# JH_MoreExalted_Adaptive_1_7_version
Jupiter hell mod separated out as Epyon implemented his version of the ADAPTIVE exalted trait in version 1.8.

This mod replaces his version with the version I implemented against 1.7.

* ADAPTIVE - Gains damage resistance based on the last damage type taken, and a random damage type malus.
